## 🖥️ Computer Software

### 💾 Operating System
- macOS - MacBook Pro M1 Max 16" for composing articles and research papers
- [Ubuntu Desktop 24.04 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) - [Framework Laptop 16"](https://frame.work/products/laptop16-diy-amd-7040) that used in FPGA/SoC design, system project development, and CTF Reverse/Pwn problem-solving tools.

### 🌏 Browser
- [Brave](https://brave.com/) - A browser with built-in ad blocking and tracker blocking features, which, when properly configured, can prevent redirects to malicious websites.

### 🗓️ Schedule management
- Apple Calendar - The default calendar app in macOS, keeping track of monthly to-dos.

### 📟 Terminal-related tools
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) - The most powerful terminal editor, bar none; its rich set of shortcuts lets you accomplish anything without taking your fingers off the keyboard.
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) - A powerful terminal session management tool. Remote-controlled experiments often take a lot of time, and it’s common to step away for a meal while the experiment is running, but there’s always the risk of SSH disconnects due to network issues. With session management, you can resume your experiment results. Also, since multiple windows are often needed to edit different parts of the code, tmux allows you to open multiple panes to edit separate sections simultaneously.

### 📊 Presentation Slide
- [Overleaf Beamer](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Beamer) - Commonly used in academic presentations, it natively supports various mathematical formulas. You can use it on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) or install a LaTeX compiler on your computer to create presentations. For users familiar with LaTeX syntax, it’s a powerful tool to quickly finish presentations without the hassle of managing template layouts

### 📝 Note-taking software / Text editor
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - A note-taking software that supports writing the Zettelkasten notes. Compared to Heptabase, whose whiteboard feature is more complete, its canvas feature is still sufficient.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Also known as VSCode, it’s a lightweight text editor released by Microsoft. Unlike the heavier Visual Studio IDE, it’s well-suited for viewing markdown or JSON files.

### 🗂️ Academic Software
- [EndNote 21](https://endnote.com/product-details/) - Universities in Taiwan almost always purchase the 2021 license, which is used to record the papers I've read. It’s very convenient to insert references into Microsoft Word or Overleaf
- [TeXShop](https://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/) - On macOS, I use VSCode to edit TeX files and can also compile them locally. Once, when the Overleaf website went down at night while I was rushing to finish a report, I was really anxious. That’s when I realized the importance of having a backup plan. I recommend saving a copy of your favorite Overleaf templates to your hard drive as a backup

### 💬 Communication Software
- Discord - Many cybersecurity communities like to create private Discord servers for discussions, which have been very beneficial.

### 🎞️ Video Editing Software
- [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/) - The most popular editing software on macOS, and also the reason I can’t leave macOS.
- [Streamlabs](https://streamlabs.com/) - An optimized version developed on top of OBS. Although OBS supports various plugins for assistance, it can sometimes lag on macOS. In comparison, Streamlabs improves some features without using too much computer resources. It can still be used for streaming and recording, especially with pane-style recording that allows capturing the screen, webcam, and microphone audio simultaneously.

### 💻 Website Building Tool
- [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) - A dynamic website building system; if there are form or interaction requirements, it can only rely on systems with a database.
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - A static site generator that, when combined with GitHub Pages, can create very beautiful websites.

## 📜 E-Ink Product
- [Readmoo Mooink Pro 2C](https://goodereader.com/blog/electronic-readers/readmoo-mooink-pro-2c-is-a-13-3-e-ink-kaleido-3-e-note) - The first 13.3-inch colour e-paper reader on the Taiwanese market was launched by Readmoo. Its flexible screen makes the device very lightweight and thin, allowing me to hold it while walking when reading papers. I can also hold it in one hand and write on the blackboard with the other during lectures—truly a great companion for research.
- [Kobo Clara BW](https://www.amazon.com/Kobo-Glare-Free-Touchscreen-ComfortLight-Audiobooks/dp/B0D1KV8J76) - Kobo’s smallest 6-inch black-and-white device is very handy when going out. It fits perfectly in my pants pocket.
